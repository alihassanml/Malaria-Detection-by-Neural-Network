# Malaria Detection by Neural Network using Deep Learning

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to detect malaria in blood smear images. The convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture implemented in this project is trained on a dataset of blood smear images containing both malaria-infected and uninfected samples.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- numpy
- tensorflow_datasets

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib tensorflow numpy tensorflow_datasets
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/alihassanml/Malaria-Detection-by-Neural-Network.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd malaria-detection
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Malaria_Detection.ipynb`:

```bash
jupyter notebook Malaria_Detection.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the neural network model and perform malaria detection on sample images.

## Dependencies

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib: For data visualization.
- tensorflow: For building and training neural networks.
- numpy: For numerical computing.
- tensorflow_datasets: For accessing the malaria dataset.
